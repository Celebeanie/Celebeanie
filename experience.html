      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        I worked as part of the fan project <strong>Gensokyo Reimagined</strong>, focusing on creating user interfaces, in-game item assets, and weapon designs.
        To provide some insight on what Gensokyo Reimagined is, it is a Minecraft MMO fan game based on the Touhou Project series, and during my involvement 
        I specialized in creating pixel art assets for different aspects of the game: items, hud, menu, icons, weapons, and tools. I don't want to spoil too much
        of the things I have done for this large scale passion project and thus included only three of the things I worked on. 
      </p>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        The first is one of the menu's 
        I designed, the loom, which I was told to make with a purple aesthetic. To tie it in with Touhou I also added talisman stuck throughout the borders in order
        to make it appear that it is trying to conceal something. I also added a golden thread to give it a mystical feel and tie it to what the loom is primarily
        used for. For the second sample I chose a scrapped icon which is based on one of the characters held weapons. For the final image it was made for one of 
        the weapons in the game, the pile driver, which I was told to make with a godly aura and autumn theme. 
      </p>
